# Building a Simple Processor

This is a part of the lab work in 2nd year <span style="color:yellow">Computer Architecture</span> course. <br>
This shows how to build a simple 8-bit single-cycle processor<br> which includes an ALU, a register file and control logic, using Verilog HDL<br>
All the specifications and details are given in the Lab 5 - Building a Simple Processor.pdf<br><br>

- Lab 5_1 - 8-bit ALU - FORWARD, ADD, AND, OR <br>
- Lab 5_2 - 8Ã—8 register file <br>
- Lab 5_3 - CPU <br>
- Lab 5_4 - Flow Control Instructions - JUMP, BEQ <br>
- Lab 5_5 - MULT, SLL, SRL, SRA, ROR, BNE <br>
